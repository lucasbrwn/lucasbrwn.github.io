I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on working in cybersecurity one day.


## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 11, Part-1

I really liked this lab because it was definitely the most challenging, but also the most interesting lab for me. I learned how to use classes to encapsulate data for states, population, and land area which was a very interesting task. This lab definitely put me to the test and I felt very accomplished after I finished the lab.

* Lab 6, Part-2

This lab was very fascinating because we coded a blackjack game that added up two cards and their values in the game. I really enjoyed this lab because it applied to the real world and it made me realize the possibilities of computer science. I realized that coding can really accomplish anything with this lab and it really motivated me to become the best computer scientist I can become. 

* Lab 10, Part-1

This lab was my favorite lab because it really helped me finally grasp the importance of vectors in computer science. This lab used vectors of counties, population, and the total percentage of Californiaâ€™s population. Using vectors to do this instead of writing out every term is so much quicker and simpler, and this lab really helped me apply vectors to real life situations.
